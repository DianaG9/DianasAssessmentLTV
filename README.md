To run this in your local environment, make sure you have `node` and `npm` installed.

Go to the root directory of the unzipped folder and run the following commands:
```
$> npm i
$> npm start
```
This will get the local server running and you should be able to see the page on your localhost


Hi team I'm Diana, 
I left comments through all the files that I changed, and you can find in the commits all the steps I took to complete the assessment. 

To Fix the QA issues
1.	To fix the mobile view I ordered the steps and divided them into 2 divs in a row.
2.	To fix the button, I searched the hover color code and changed it to the correct one and created the code to change the active color. For this step was necessary to use “!important!” since the library was overriding the code.
3.	To change the person icon I coded width and height of the svg.
4.	I created the loading page from scratch to be shown before the result. Since the result charges quickly sometimes, I also made it mandatory to be visible for a couple of seconds to the user.
5.	Lastly, I fixed the code for the error message to take all the space of the input on the mobile and changed the margin, padding and position to be shown below the input box instead of the button box.
