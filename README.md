To run this in your local environment, make sure you have `node` and `npm` installed.

Go to the root directory of the unzipped folder and run the following commands:
```
$> npm i
$> npm start
```
This will get the local server running and you should be able to see the page on your localhost


Hi team I'm Diana,
I left comments through all the files that I changed, and you can find in the commits all the steps I took to complete the assessment.

To fix the QA issues:
1.	To fix the mobile view I ordered the steps and divided them into 2 divs in a row.
2.	To fix the button, I searched the hover color code and changed it to the correct one and created the code to change the active color. For this step was necessary to use “!important” since the library was overriding the code.
3.	To change the person icon I coded width and height of the svg.
4.	I created the loading page from scratch to be shown before the result. Since the result charges quickly sometimes, I also made it mandatory to be visible for a couple of seconds to the user.
5.	Lastly, I fixed the code for the error message to take all the space of the input on the mobile and changed the margin, padding and position to be shown below the input box instead of the button box.

Bonus point: On the QA document wasn’t metion that the search button was different from the spect. I aligned both the input box and the search button, provided a margin to separate them , changed the border radius to “!important”  since the boostrap library was overriding the code.

For the second part, I designed from scratch the tab to change between email and phone search, provided the css code to match the spect and added the function to search from phone number.

For the last part, I took a look mainly to the code on the index.js file and changed some of the conditional logic to have a cleaner and more efficient code.

Lastly, I took the liberty to add a brief animation to load the page at the start!

This exercise was very interesting to do since I had some challenges coding and using things I hadn't done before, it was an enriching experience. I focused mostly to complete the task asked but with more time there are details that can be corrected and improved such as the spaces and margins on the responsive part and details that I know can make the difference. 

Hope to get in touch with you soon and would love feedback! 

Thank you!
